Project Title : Posture Recognition and Correction in an active Training Scenario

Project Authors : Varadaraya G Shenoy, Vibhav Hosahalli Venkataramaiah, Vignesh S P

Description :

In any sport or weight training session, the posture maintained by the person is most
important, not only to ensure that the person performs his best, but also to ensure their safety.
This is not usually a concern when the person trains under a trained professional, who
ensures that the person is maintaining the correct posture. But in a self-taught session, the
person training who in most cases is an amateur may end up severely injuring himself. In this
project we aim to develop a platform that checks if the person training is maintaining the
correct posture, and in case he is not doing so, provide the corrections necessary.
This platform should be able to detect the current posture of the person of interest in the video and provide the steps necessary for correcting his/her posture, if and when it is improper.
This platform provides much needed feedback to ensure that the person maintains the required posture, so that one gets the desired results while ensuring his/her safety.
Currently, this platform is able to provide correction to 5 different postures namely squat,deadlift,lunge,glute bridge and plank.
